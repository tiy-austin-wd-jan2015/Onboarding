## Welcome!

It’s almost time for our first day of class! Before we get started, I recommend getting a head start on some of the class topics, so that you’re better prepared to learn how to be a web designer. I expect that you can accomplish and learn as much of the pre-work listed below without assistance so that we can spend class time only on those things that are difficult to learn on your own. That being said, feel free to email me if you have any questions at [sam@theironyard.com](mailto:sam@theironyard.com).

## Prework

Web Design has a lot of different elements to consider. One point I’d like to make clear: Web Design is not just about making things look good, but rather its about juggling a bunch of elements such as: content, imagery, illustration, icon systems, typography, color theory and concepts to create a fully functioning and visually appealing design system. One of the biggest challenges will juggling all of those elements into a cohesive system and involves researching, experimenting, designing, coding, and testing. Learning these skills **will take time and it won’t always be easy**, and this pre-work will help introduce you to some of the ideas and skills that will form the foundation of your in-person learning experience.

This work should be completed by January 1st and any deliverables should be emailed to me by then. I will assume that you have completed this work before class, so you will likely feel very far behind if you haven’t completed it when we start class on January 5th.

### Objectives

The following are the learning objectives for this pre-work, all of which are important requirements expected of a professional Web Designer. Though they are not technically coding skills, they are **crucially** important to success both during the class and on the job.

1.  Be able to communicate technical accomplishments and struggles in designing, coding, and writing.
2.  Be able to learn in contexts that aren’t necessarily suited to your primary learning style.
3.  Adapt to the workflows used by professional Web Designers (we’ve cover a few common ones in class).
4.  Commit yourself fulling to learning as much as in can and completing all assignments to the best of your ability.
5.  Describe the importance of mindset on learning and be able to analyze one’s own type of mindset.

### Mindset and Learning

1.  Read [Fixed vs. Growth: The Two Basic Mindsets That Shape Our Lives](http://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/)
2.  Compose an email with a subject line of "Mindsets Responses" to Sam (sam@theironyard.com) answering the following questions:
3.  What aspects of the Growth and Fixed mindset can you identify in your personal history? In what areas do you feel Fixed? Where do you see the most Growth?
4.  What difficulties do you predict that you will encounter during our course? How have you reacted to similar situations in the past? How do you plan on reacting to these situations during the class?

### Computer Setup

Install OSX Yosemite, if you haven’t already (it’s free):

1.  You'll need to sign in to the Mac App Store with you Apple ID. If you don't have one, [sign up here](https://appleid.apple.com/).
2.  Download the Yosemite upgrade from the Apple Store: [download here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-yosemite/id915041082?mt=12).
3.  Double-click "Install OS X Yosemite” to begin installation.
**WARNING**: The OS X upgrade can take a bit of time to complete and will require a restart. Plan on doing this in the evening or over a lunch break.

### Adobe Creative Cloud

Sign up for [Adobe Creative Cloud](https://creative.adobe.com/plans) (You can use everything free for the first 30 days but the will have to pay for at least the 12 weeks of class. There are two options we recommend:

#### Option 1:

The CC annual account, paid monthly: $49.99 for all of the programs if the you agree to one year contract
Total student cost for 4 months = $200 plus tax
(plus remaining 8 months = $600 plus tax)

#### Option 2:

The CC monthly account month-to-month pricing: $74.99 for all of the programs (without cancellation fees)
Total student cost for 4 months = $300 plus tax

### Photoshop and Illustrator

Make sure you download these two programs from Creative Cloud. We will use them regularly.

### HTML and CSS

HTML and CSS are the foundation of all the content of webpages, web sites, or web apps. However, we will only be spending about a week on HTML and CSS, so you should have a basic foundation before the class starts.

Complete the course: [CodeAcademy – Web Track](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web), which covers HTML and CSS. This should take you approximately 7-12 hours, depending on your prior experience.

### Markdown

Learn Markdown, a simple language that converts simple text to code through [this tutorial](http://markdowntutorial.com/).

### Typing

Believe it or not, _a lot_ of time in the first weeks of coding and programming is spent fixing simple typing errors. It would not be ridiculous to suggest that many of you will spend 12-24 hours (or more) fixing typing errors during class.

If you don't know how to touch type (i.e. type without looking at the keyboard), try to spend some time each day working on touch typing (you can try [KEYBR](http://www.keybr.com/)). Typing for programming is actually a good bit different than everyday typing, so getting some practice in could potentially save you a ton of time the first few weeks of class.
